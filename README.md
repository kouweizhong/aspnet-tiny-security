ASP.NET Tiny Security Providers is a free, open source, pack of tiny ASP.NET Membership, Role and Profile providers.
The goal of this project is to provide custom implementation of ASP.NET providers against tiny data storages (XML, SQL Compact etc.).

**Features**
* Native support and usage by all ASP.NET membership controls;
* Supports all password formats: Clear, Encrypted and Hashed;

Tiny Security Providers best fit for sites with a small number of authenticated users and hosted without database access.  
It is not recommended to use the providers with "heavy-duty" membership sites (a lot of roles, users and big number of members), because of the tiny data storages.
